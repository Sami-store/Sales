The code outlines a Java application with several key methods for handling password validation, generating sales data, writing to a file, and reading from a file. The main method orchestrates the following steps:

    Password Validation: Calls the validatePassword method to ensure the password meets specific criteria:
        At least 4 characters long.
        Contains at least one uppercase letter.
        Contains at least one digit.
        Throws an exception if the password does not meet these requirements.

    Sales Data Generation: Calls the generateSales method, which:
        Generates an array of 10 random integers between 5 and 100.
        Returns the generated array.

    Writing to a File: Calls the writeToFile method, passing the sales data array:
        Writes the integers to a file named numbers.txt.
        Returns the filename and handles any exceptions that may occur.

    Reading from a File: Calls the readNumbers method with the filename:
        Reads the contents of the file into an ArrayList of integers.
        Catches any file not found exceptions that may occur.
        Returns the populated ArrayList.

    Output: The final ArrayList of integers is printed to the console, with any exceptions caught and handled appropriately.
